-JSON import doesn't display transactions although it says successful

-CSV import should have a reconcile checkbox on the modal offering the user to reconcile all imported transactions regardless of transaction matches

-arvest (i think)csv import was all zeros, usaa format seems good.  Align those with bank format types in code before submitting

-If check#/code not defined on imported csv leave it blank, not undefined

-need a date date picker in purge function and text entry shoukd be mm/dd/yyyy instead if yyyy-mm-dd as it currently is.
