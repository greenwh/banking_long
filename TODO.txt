The problems I finding deal primarily with imports.  Lets separate data-io into its own module.  Move Import JSON, Export JSON, Import CSV, and associated functions including csv import recociliation logic

-JSON import doesn't display transactions although it says successful

-CSV import should have a reconcile checkbox on the modal offering the user to reconcile all imported transactions regardless of transaction matches

-format1 csv import was all zeros, format2 format seems good. The amounts in format1 are positive for deposits and negative for withdrawals. 

-If check#/code not defined on imported csv leave it blank, not undefined

Not IO
- need a date date picker in purge function and text entry shoukd be mm/dd/yyyy instead if yyyy-mm-dd as it currently is. 
- make column 1 5 character width
